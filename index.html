                <h1>Proposal</h1>
                <h3>The goal is to create a website that has mulitple calculators that can be used to calulate statistics after a game. Instead of searching for the formulas, 
                    there will be a site that has calculators at the ready.
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Have a page and multiple calculators for baseball, hockey, and golf statistics</li>
                    <li>Make it feel like a sports themed site</li>
                    <li>Make each sport selection feel themed to that sport</li>
                </ol>

                <h1 id="example_page">Example Page</h1>
                <a href="https://www.easycalculation.com/sports/sports.php"><img id="click_img" alt="Example Web Page" src="images/webpage_link.png"></a>

                <h1>Content</h1> 
                <h2>Web Page Design:</h2>
                <p>The home page will have a description of what the site will be used for. There will be a section for each sport that will have a list of the statistics calculators 
                     that I plan on having. The sections will look similar to the sections that are on the example site but they backgrounds will have images of the sport correlating
                     to each sport.
                </p>
                <h2>Other Pages:</h2>
                <p>The other pages will mirror the home page theme but also incorporate the theme of the sport selected for that calculator. If I clicked ERA Calculator, then it would
                    bring up that calculator on a new page with the main theme with the theme of baseball incorporated.
                </p>

                <h1>Audinece</h1>
                <p>The target audience is going to be anyone who wants to watch sports and keeps track of the basic stat such as shots, goals, time played, and etc. They would
                    then take these basic stats and open up this site so they could do quick calculations of stats that require a combination of these basic recorded stats.
