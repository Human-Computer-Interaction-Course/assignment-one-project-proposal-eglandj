                <h1>Proposal</h1>
                <h3>The goal is to create a website that has mulitple calculators that can be used to calulate statistics after a game. Instead of searching for the formulas, 
                    there will be a site that has calculators at the ready.
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Have a page and multiple calculators for baseball, hockey, and golf statistics</li>
                    <li>Make it feel like a sports themed site</li>
                    <li>Make each sport selection feel themed to that sport</li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <h1 id="example_page">Example Page</h1>
                <p>I chose this site because it has similar calculators that I plan on recreating. The site has a very old 95 feel to it and I would like to have a site that
                    feels more modern.
                </p>

                    that I plan on having. The sections will look similar to the sections that are on the example site but they backgrounds will have images of the sport correlating
                    to each sport.
                </p>

                <p>The ERA page will have a description of what ERA is and how it is measured. There will then be an input box for earned runs and another
                    input box for innings pitched.

                <h2>Slugging Percentage Page:</h2>

                <h1>Audience</h1>
                <p>The target audience is going to be anyone who wants to watch sports and keeps track of the basic stat such as shots, goals, time played, and etc. They would
                    then take these basic stats and open up this site so they could do quick calculations of stats that require a combination of these basic recorded stats.
